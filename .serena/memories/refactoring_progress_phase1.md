# Backend Refactoring Progress - Phase 1

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Upstream Packages Verified ✅
- `config` package: Building successfully
- `database` package: Building successfully
- `generated` package: Building successfully

### 2. Domain Models Implemented ✅
- **Customer**: Full domain model with Sum types, business logic, and validation
- **Salon**: Full domain model with operational state management
- **Staff**: Full domain model with availability and permission management
- **Service**: Full domain model with pricing and availability logic
- **Reservation**: Full domain model with booking management and cancellation logic

### 3. Mappers Implemented ✅
- **Customer Mappers**: Create/Update/Read mappers with full API↔DB transformation
- **Salon Mappers**: Create/Read mappers
- **Staff Mappers**: Create/Update/Read mappers
- **Service Mappers**: Create/Update/Read mappers with staff level enum conversion

### 4. Architecture Decisions Made
- Using Sum types (discriminated unions) for all state management
- Pattern matching with ts-pattern for exhaustive handling
- Result types for error handling (no exceptions)
- Brand types for type-safe IDs
- Mapper pattern: Write (API→Domain→DB) and Read (DB→Domain→API)
- Handling mismatches between DB schema and API types

### 5. Key Issues Resolved
- Fixed type compatibility between generated types and domain models
- Resolved Result type usage (ok()/err() pattern)
- Handled nullable database fields
- Created shim types for missing generated type definitions
- Fixed staff level enum↔number conversion
- Removed nanoid dependency, using crypto API for ID generation

## Current State
- Domain package builds successfully with no errors
- All implemented models follow consistent patterns
- Type safety maintained throughout

## Next Steps
1. Create Reservation mappers (Write/Read)
2. Implement Booking domain model with mappers
3. Implement Review domain model with mappers  
4. Implement Attachment domain model with mappers
5. Create business logic use cases in domain/business-logic
6. Refactor infrastructure package to use new domain models
7. Refactor API package routes to use new domain/infrastructure
8. Update package.json exports for proper subpath imports
9. Final verification of all packages
