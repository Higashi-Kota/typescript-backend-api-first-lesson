# Backend Refactoring Status - Phase 2

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Schema Alignment Fixed
- TypeSpec models updated to match database schema
- Key fixes: `bookingId` instead of `reservationId` in reviews
- Field name alignments: `overallRating`, `imageUrls`, `cleanlinessRating`, `valueRating`
- Types regenerated successfully from updated TypeSpec

### 2. Upstream Packages Verified âœ…
- `config` package: Builds successfully
- `database` package: Builds successfully  
- `generated` package: Builds successfully with correct types

### 3. Domain Package Progress
- Domain models updated to use generated types
- Review mappers fixed with correct field mappings
- JavaScript builds successfully but TypeScript has errors

## ðŸ”§ Remaining Issues

### Type Mismatches
1. **CreateReviewRequest**: Generated type has `bookingId` but domain expects old structure
2. **Booking model**: Missing many DB fields in domain interface
3. **Salon model**: Missing DB fields like `phoneNumber`, `email`, `prefecture`
4. **Repository interfaces**: Missing methods like `findByName`, `listActive`, `findByBookingId`

### Architecture Issues
1. Domain models need to properly extend generated types
2. Repository interfaces need updating with required methods
3. Business logic has hardcoded error type strings instead of using enum values

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Complete Domain Package**
   - Fix remaining type issues in models
   - Update repository interfaces with missing methods
   - Ensure all use cases compile

2. **Infrastructure Package**
   - Implement repository implementations
   - Implement services (email, storage, etc.)
   - Connect to database using drizzle

3. **API Package**
   - Update routes to use new domain/infrastructure
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add validation middleware

## Key Decisions Made
- Follow TypeSpec as source of truth
- Database schema is canonical, API adapts to it
- Use mapper pattern for all transformations
- No backward compatibility maintained
